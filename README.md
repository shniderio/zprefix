# How to use:
    User can create an account with the sign up button which will redirect you to a signup form.
    After account creation you will be redirected to the login page again.
    You can login to the page with the newly created user, or the seeded users.
    This page will render all your inventory if you have anything, if not it will say you don't have any items.
    You can add items to your inventory with the Add inventory button.
    You can also edit or delete items you have created in your inventory from this page.
    The browse all items button will redirect you to a list of all items made by everyone.
    If you are logged in you are able to delete any item as well.
    If you are not logged in you are only able to see them. The list contains all the information for all items and what user created them.
    You are able to logout with the logout button (obviously).
